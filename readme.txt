This is a "library" project, which was a part from The Odin 
Project's curriculum.
The goal was to practice "Objects" and "Prototypes" part of the 
Javascript curriculum.

We had to figure out how to design an object template and then create
new objects (books) with a constructor function.
We had to write all functions on our own.

In addition of objects, there was a lot of DOM manipulation
going on when developing this project. And of course CSS and
HTML writing.

Versions:

Version 1:
- Wrote constructor function
- Wrote "create book" function
- Added functionality to buttons - the trickiest was "remove
  book" button, because I had to link each button with each 
  object's index in Library array.
- Added an "input field" which prompts when we press "add new
  book" button.
- Library now accepts new books, and we can delete existing ones
- Took about 4 hours to complete.

Version 2:
- Edited CSS, made it look nicer
- Added functionality to "read" button
- This version took about 2 hours to complete
